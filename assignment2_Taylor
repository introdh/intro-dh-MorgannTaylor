I chose to look at articles that pertained to Health from 1972- 2012. I first selected to look for items particularly relating to nutrition within the Environmental Health Perspectives Journal. When we first started this, I learned that you could not put in keywords since we are using topic modeling. The results I received were different than I expected, but they still fell along the same guidelines of public health.
