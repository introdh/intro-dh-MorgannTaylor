## Who will get funded?!

The class is the grants committee. 

Each person will vote on several components of the project [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhIh2ghossqAU5h1e0oTlJl1MeriCLLrHbM6qHUs2TtDyDEA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

They will rank your grant in the following four areas:

- States the humanities question(s) being posed 
- Description of the scope and purpose of the project
- Explaination of the DH methods being used and/or developed and why
- Explains why the project is necessary

 
Attendance at both classes is required or this component of the final grade will be a zero.
