# Assignment 1

The goal of this assignment is to collect and document a humanities data set. 

## Data Set
Store the data set as tidy data as discussed in class.  The data set must:
- Have at least two tables linked by an identifier. 
- The larger table must have at least 30 elements.
- The smaller table must have at least 5 elements.
- Contain at least two numeric variables.
- Contain at least one date variable.
- Contain at least three categorical variables. 
- Contain at least two character variables.

Submit your data as .csv files  (one for each table) in the GitHub repository.
Please name them "table1.csv" and "table2.csv".

## Data Documentation

Along with the data, submit a markdown file (approx. 500 words) explaining the following:
- The humanities topic that guided your data collection.
- The question(s) we can pose and answer with the data.
- The source(s) of the data.

The response should also include a data dictionary, which is made up of a bulleted list explaining what each variable in the tables mean. Be as precise as possible.  Make sure to include the variable type. 

Please save as "assignment1.md".
