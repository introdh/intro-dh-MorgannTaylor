# Assignment 3: Spatial Analysis 



## Part 1: Your Map

Build your map in ArcGIS. It should be georectified and include contemporary census data. The maps you design should be included in your paper.

## Part 2: Paper

The 500-1500 word paper should address the following:

- Discuss the process of georeferencing and building your map. 

- Assuming the reader is unfamiliar, contextualize your map. In other, what is this a map of?  What kinds of space and place are being represented? Draw on [Mapping Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=4/36.71/-96.93&opacity=0.8) and Amy Hillier's article. 

- As Richard White states, "visualization and spatial history are not about producing illustrations or maps to communicate things that you have discovered by other means. It is a means of doing research; it generates questions that might otherwise go unasked, it reveals historical relations that might otherwise go unnoticed, and it undermines, or substantiates, stories upon which our versions of the past" (White, What is Spatial History?, 2010). What questions does your map generate about the past and the present?

- Pick a contemporary census tract using your map and compare/contrast with redlining from [Mapping Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=4/36.71/-96.93&opacity=0.8). Consider using [Social Explorer](https://www.socialexplorer.com/) to dive deeper. What can we learn about how the census tract/ neighborhood has or hasn't changed?

- Drawing on the constraints, critiques and ideas (ex. "deep maps") outlined by Bodenhamer and Crampton, discuss the challenges of representing space and place as applied to your map. How might you be able to address some of these issues in the future?
