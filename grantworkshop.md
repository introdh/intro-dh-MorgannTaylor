# Grant Workshop


## Question/ Abstract

Here in your repository, write your answers to the following: 

(1) Formulate the humanities question(s) guiding the project. 


(2) Provide a one-paragraph abstract written for a nonspecialist audience, clearly explaining the projectâ€™s principal activities and its expected results.

The characterstics of a strong abstract:

- explains the humanities question(s) guiding the project
- includes the DH methods that will be used and why
- identifies which humanities fields/ disciplines the project is engaged in 







## Peer Review


In your group, share your question(s)/ abstract and answer the following questions:

- Is there a clear humanities question guiding the project? 
- Can the humanities question being posed be addressed by the outlined abstract?
- Is the question and/or abstract too vague or too broad?
- Where would the data come from? Does it need to be created? Potential sources?
- Could this project be accomplished in 1-2 years?
- Is there a similar project already in process?
