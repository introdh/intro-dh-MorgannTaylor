### 2017-09-18: Distant reading
 "What is Distant Reading"
  
    "To understand literature, Moretti argues, we must stop reading books."
          - This article was very interesting because of the idea. Moretti claims that no matter how many books someone reads, there is no way they would read every book about an area. There are thousands of books about the same thing, and perhaps a digital program would make it easier for someone to compare everything. 
     "I admire Moretti’s honesty in saying this: most scholars, whatever their disciplinary background, do not publish negative results.But I would admire it more if he didn’t elsewhere dismiss qualitative literary analysis as “a theological exercise.”"
           -I am still a little bit confused what is meant by this. I understand what is meant that someone would not publish negative results for their own agenda. But I am lost what is meant by a "theological excercise". 
 
"Jocker's"

   "We understand that the conclusions drawn are only as good as the evidence gathered, and we hope that the gathering of evidence is done both ethically and completely."
          - This goes back to what we talked about in class. That we can "hope" that evidence is gathered ethically and in a truthful manner, but there is always a chance that the data can be scewed. 
   "The approach to the study of literature that I am calling “macroanalysis” is in some general ways akin to economics or, more specifically, to macroeconomics."
          - I am still unsure how they are connecting this approach is considred similar to economics. I understand the information about data and collecting/arranging information gathered. 
 
"Graphs, Maps, and Trees" Franco Moretti

   "Because if the downturns are individual events, then looking for individual causes (Napoleon, reprints, the cost of paper, whatever) makes perfect sense; but if they are parts of a pattern, then what we must explain is the pattern as a whole, not just one of its phases." (pg. 13)
         - This is very interesting because it reminds someone to look at what is happening overall with a graph versus just looking at one part. I think a lot of the time when we are looking at a graph, we notice the high/mins/ the outliers, but looking at the trend is just as important. 
   "Here, the methodology of the book reveals its pragmatic ambition: for me, abstraction is not an end in itself, but a way to widen the domain of the literary historian, and enrich its internal problematic."
         - After reading the first chapter, I am still confused what is being referred to as an abstraction. If we are talking about how to find data on literary books by sorting and organizing data we gather from the books, I am unsure what the abstraction is. Why would it be an end? 
          

### 2017-09-25: Topic modeling I

##### Topic Modeling: A Basic Introduction

"Topic modeling is a form of text mining, a way of identifying patterns in a corpus. You take your corpus and run it through a tool which groups words across the corpus into ‘topics’."

   - So topic modeling to me means that there is a program which can extract words "mining" and it can be used to organize the subject material into topics. 
   
"What, then, is a topic? One definition offered on Twitter during a conference on topic modeling described a topic as “a recurring pattern of co-occurring words.” 
    - I feel like the word topic shoudl be different. When I think of a topic I think of book genres or the topic of an essay, what the information is about. But to me, I don't understand how topics can be be derrived by words. 
    
##### The Digital Humanities Contribution to Topic Modeling

" It is distant reading in the most pure sense: focused on corpora and not individual texts, treating the works themselves as unceremonious “buckets of words,” and providing seductive but obscure results in the forms of easily interpreted (and manipulated) “topics.” "

   - I like the way this is described. As a "bucket of words" I can visualize how the words are dumped into a bucket, and then arranged by the frequency in the bucket for example. 
   
"Topic modeling itself is about 15 years old, arriving from the world of computer science, machine learning, and information retrieval."

   - I would be interested in knowing what teh first topic modeling project was used to understand. 15 years old seems like a very long time for computers. I would have been in kindergarten and that was when we learned how to type using a system on a floppy disk. 
   
##### MARTHA BALLARD’S DIARY

"And I would go day by day for every other year of the diary, and I would tick off what was in each entry: baking or brewing, spinning or washing, or trading, sewing, mending, deliveries, general medical accounts, going to church, visitors, people coming for meals, etc.”"

   - Earlier I asked what were the earlier examples of topic modeling and now I understand how it happened. To go page by page, entry by entry, and having to check off which topic it would fall under is tedious but interesting. But to me, the pages were being read, and that feels mroe right versus a computer collecting words that are repeated. 
   
"The diary’s format translates quite nicely into creating a list of lists – the “main” diary being a list of all the entries, and each entry being a list in and of itself. "

  - This does not seem like the type of topic modeling that we have tried. Lists of words versus a formatted list seem very different to me. 
  
### 2017-10-02: Topic Modeling II

##### Signs art 40
"Using Topic Modeling, a computer-assisted means of dividing a large corpus of texts into topics, this browser explores the Signs archive by dividing it into several topics and tracing how those topics change over time." 
      - I find this description of topic modeling easier to understand than previously in class. Topic modeling is using the computer to divde a corpus into topics. 
"Feminist scholars, purse lines of inquiry and analysis prompted by this anniversary project, particularly the topic modeling." 
      - I am a bit confused what it means that scholars take topic modeling and create projects. I understand that using topic modeling, you get a list of relevant topics for a select number of journals. But I do not understand where you go from there. 
##### Mining the Dispatch
"The former was produced by scholars, librarians and technologists at the University of Richmond and Tufts University's Perseus Project."
      - I had no idea that this was produced by people at the University of Richmond. It is really interesting to see things that people on campus are doing or have helped to create. 
      
"It uses as its evidence nearly the full run of the Richmond Daily Dispatch from the eve of Lincoln's election in November 1860 through the evacuation of the city in April 1865 (at which point publication of the Dispatch ceased) to December 1865 (when publication of the Dispatch resumed), an archive of over 112,000 pieces consisting of nearly 24 million words."
      - This is interesting, as I did not think that there would be so many pieces during that time. I understand that it was historically Richmond based, but I wonder if including more from other large cities at the time, would have helped understand what was going on. Isn't it better to look macro versus micro?

##### Text Analysis of Trump's Tweets
  
"When Trump wishes the Olympic team good luck, he’s tweeting from his iPhone. When he’s insulting a rival, he’s usually tweeting from an Android. "
      - I find this very interesting that we can apply topic modeling to more things that just literary journals. I think this helps me connect topic modeling into something I could use. 

"Overall, this includes 628 tweets from iPhone, and 762 tweets from Android."
      - I do wonder if this is enough of a database. Could they have gone further back to include texts previously to running to office? How large does the corpus need to be? 
      
##### Data Miners Dig for Answers About Harper Lee, Truman Capote and ‘Go Set a Watchman’
"Hours after “Go Set a Watchman”went on sale Tuesday, the developers of a
computerized text­analysis tool ran the long­awaited novel and Ms. Lee’s Pulitzer­Prize
winning “To Kill a Mockingbird” through an algorithm that searched for signs of heavy
editing, frequent rewriting and other influences."

     -I found this amazing that someone/ a program can help determine if it took alot of rewriting while creating a book. I have read "Go set a Watchman" after reading "To Kill a Mockingbird" and there was definitely a different voice throughout the book. I find it really cool that we can use a computer program to discover that too. 
"The researchers used a computer program to tally the frequency of common words —“the,” “a,” “he,” “she”—and other “function” words that they said typically make up 50%
of a novel."
       - I thought we did not use connecting words with software that we use? Or is it something that is based on each project and what that person is looking for? 


### 2017-10-23: Mapping: A Critical Introductin

##### BEYOND GIS
" Whithin a GIS, users can discover relationships that make a complex world more immediately understandable by visually detecting spatial patterns."

    - I think I am still confused what spacial analysis is. I think I need to see an example, or participate in an example to understand the concept. 
    
" A well-presented argument often does not settle a question; it may complicate it or open new questions that previously were unimagined." 

    - This is very similar to what we had talked abotu in class. That an argument is up to interpretation. Also, due to this class, it also brings up the idea that what are facts and how do you determine if a fact can be trusted or not? 
    
##### What is Spatial History

"It is a humble —if demanding and expensive— attempt to do history in a different way." 

    - I am curious about how this program or spatial analysis can be expensive. I get the general ideas, but I do not understand how it requires so much or if it expensive. I may have read this completely wrong, but I wonder the platforms used and how easy it is to run a spatial analysis. 
    
"Visible evidence of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) across the United States can be seen above in the aerial landscape photos by Alex MacLean."

    - This is one of the best visuals I have seen in this class yet. It is interesting how so many things can work together in order to develop a question and pose a response. Seeing the layout of the land followed by the map of the U.S., it is amazing how so much can be shown using the computer or other platforms. 
    
##### A Data Model for Spatial History

"The second type of digitization combines data from two or more digitized primary sources, based on a common "attribute" like a time or place, to create new materials."
    - This is the first time I have picted up on the idea of using primary sources in these documents. Similar to what I spoke about before, it is important to understand where people are getting their data from, and if it is valid or not. That will definitely be a take away from this class. Understanding facts and data, and determining what to do with it, as well as verifying it. 
    
"It is our hope that future researchers become part of the scholarly commons by contributing to our geodatabase." 
    - I am a bit conused how scholars use this? I understand what the proffessor talked about in class, how he used new articles to use topic models. But say a historian wanted to study a subject, would they consult someone who is interested in Digital humanites to further explain their project? 
    
##### American Panorama    
    
"Through HOLC, in particular, real estate appraisers used the apparent racial and cultural value of a community to determine its economic value."

    - This is probably the first example that I actually understand what is going on. I think having someone from the site, come in and talk to us and show us what everything means, helps explain things a bit further. Honestly, the first few weeks I was a bit confused for what Digital Humanities consisted of. But after seeing this and a few other examples, I am able to get a grasp of just what Digital Humanities is able to do. 
    
"That number is then divided by half of the growth rate as to avoid double counting reproduction in both in-migrating and out-migrating areas."

    - A few times in calss, we have talked about equations and how they relate and process data. I am curious how people come up with formulas to understand the data, or is it purely mathematical? 
    

### 2017-11-06: Social networks

##### Demystifying Networks, Parts I & II

"Methodology appropriation is dangerous. Even when the people designing a methodology for some specific purpose get it right—and they rarely do—there is often a score of theoretical and philosophical caveats that get lost when the methodology gets translated. "
         - I am a bit comfused what methodology means. I am assuming the author is talking about two different approaches to networks. 
         
"Generally, network studies are made under the assumption that neither the stuff nor the relationships are the whole story on their own."
         - This article was probably one of the best I've read this semester for explaining the main idea. I always thought a network was life a web one connecting piece to another. But it actually is alot more! The relationships are based on so many forms of data and nodes. 
  
##### Linked Jazz

"New modes of connecting cultural data have the potential to open up new and unprecedented avenues of research and community engagement."

     - I think this is really interesting. The Linked Jazz site was fairly easy to navigate and had a great topic!
     
"If the same individual already has a URI in DBPedia, we create a sameAs triple to connect that URI with our Linked Jazz URI."

    - I do not quite understand why each individual needs multiple URI's. Couldn't they all connect with the same URI? 
 
 ##### Literary Lab Pamphlet
 
 "A network is made of vertices and edges; a plot, of characters and actions: characters will
be the vertices of the network, interactions the edges[.] " 

   - I feel like this is an easy way to understand what a network tryly is. The Hamlet example was a better way of seeing it. 
   
"Third consequence of this approach: once you make a network of a play, you stop working
on the play proper, and work on a model instead"

   - I am a little confused what this means. I understand that when you start looking at the structure, you can see all of the little bits that don't fit, but how do you get it from a created network to the structure. 
   
##### Topic Modeling and Network Analysis

"Since shortly after Blei’s first publication, researchers have been looking into the interplay between networks and topic models."

   - I thought I understood what a topic model and a network were, however I am not sure why they aren't the same. I would think a topic model is from networks and without a network a topic model would not exist? 
   
"Now it’s time to pull out the topics and start writing. It’s an easy process; each topic is a bag filled with words."

   - I finally understand Topic Modeling! I think I am getting what a network actually is confused. I think once we do an example in class, that will help me understand it better. 
   
##### Contextualizing networks with maps

"A network on its own is a set of meaningless relationships without a knowledge of what travels through and across it, what entities make it up, and how that network interacts with the larger world"

   - I think I understand this. A network is a bunch of items that are related, but they need to be understood to form a relationship. I may be totally wrong, but this is what makes sense to me. 
   
"Network space rarely corresponds to geographic place, however neither of them alone can ever fully represent the landscape within which we are situated" 

   - I am confused how a network and geography can be similar. Wouldn't a network stay within an environment. Similar to how we talked about the meaning of a safe place as an actual place versus an atmosphere. 

### 2017-11-13: Layering Networks

##### Network Theory Plot Analysis

"A network is made of vertices and edges; a plot, of characters and actions: characters will
be the vertices of the network, interactions the edges"

   - When we talked in class, I understoof what Plot Anaylsis was and how networks play into them. I think looking into the Hamlet readings really helped to understnad different ways we can use a network. 
   
"This had happened before of course, without producing lasting
effects, but this time it’s probably going to be different, because this time we have digital
databases, and automated data retrieval. "

   - I feel sometimes that these readings have me following along, and then they use terms that I am not sure of. I am a bit confused what automated data retrieval is. I am sure I have used something similar, but I am curious to know what exactly that is or if that is like R or something else. 
   
##### Topic Modeling and Network Anaylsis

"So why is the generative nature of the model so important? One of the key reasons is the ability to work backwards."

   - I understand what topic modeling is, but I am not sure how someone can work backwards from it. Would that be taking a look at what is found and then analysing it? 
   
"Topic models can interact with networks in multiple ways. While a lot of the recent interest in digital humanities has surrounded using networks to visualize how documents or topics relate to one another, the interfacing of networks and topic modeling initially worked in the other direction."

   - To me, topic modeling is the easiest way to understand the graphing or the visualization that we have been focusing on. I think it just makes sense that there are journals for example, then the words extracted can make up topics, and then we can assign the topics general names based on what the findings were. 
   
##### Contextualizing networks with maps

"Humanists are starkly aware that no particular aspect of a subject sits in a vacuum; context is key. A network on its own is a set of meaningless relationships without a knowledge of what travels through and across it, what entities make it up, and how that network interacts with the larger world."

   - I love this. One thing I will defintely take away from this class is the fact that there needs to be a context. Not just context, but there needs to be a focus on where the information is coming from and if it is reliable or not. Previously, I was given data and figured out what to do with it, but now I understand the importance of taking a deeper look at the data itself. 
   
"By combining geography, point statistics, and networks, we can create base maps against which we can contextualize whatever we happen to be studying."

   - I am a bit confused what a base map is. I understand that we can map a network, so would the base map be just the nodes and edges? 
   
 
    
### 2017-11-27: Critical DH

##### Why Are the Digital Humanities So White? or Thinking the Histories of Race and Computation

"As I flew home following this second event, I found myself reflecting on how far my thoughts had ranged in the course a mere week: from diaspora to database, from oppression to ontology, from visual studies to visualizations."

   - I loved this site because it allowed for comments and likes within a post. This one for example had two comments from other readers. I find that to be helpful and I am curious if other sites can do that as well. 
   
"In simplest terms, UNIX is an early operating system for digital computers, one that has spawned many offshoots and clones."

   - I would like to learn a bit more on the history of computers and networks. The way this site explained this was that UNIX is the first operating system before Mac or anything. 
   
##### Reflections on a Movement: #transformDH, Growing Up

"By expanding who and what counts as DH, we can model for other academic communities the transformative power of collaborative energy to address the questions of our time."

   - In the beginning of this course, I could not tell you what DH meant. But now I understand that a great ammount of items can be considered as humanities, but you have to ask the right questions. I also now understand where the digital side comes in as well. 
   
"We need a digital humanities that will center on the intersection of digital production and social transformation through research, pedagogy, and activism, and that will not be restricted to institutional academic spaces."

   - Although I have a better understanding for what DH is, I am confused on how it is restricted. I feel like it is not just limited to "institutional academic spaces". DH can happen anywhere and with any sort of humanities questions. 
   
##### The Digital in the Humanities: A Special Interview Series

"For Bethany Nowviskie, the digital humanities means a great deal, although she states that defining what this meaning is exactly has been a “distraction” and “detraction” from the work itself. "

  - See I would argue that there should be a clear definition for what DH is. When I started this course, I googled what DH entails, and I was very confused on the matter. 

"In fact, “digital humanities” seems astoundingly inappropriate for an area of study that includes, on the one hand, computational research, digital reading and writing platforms, digital pedagogy, open-access publishing, augmented texts, and literary databases, and, on the other, media archeology and theories of networks, gaming, and wares both hard and soft. As Franco Moretti said to me early in my conversation with him: “‘digital humanities’ means nothing.”"

   - It is interesting how so many people in the field do not believe that there is a correct definition for what DH is. It is a broad subject area, but it shoudl be defined as so.
