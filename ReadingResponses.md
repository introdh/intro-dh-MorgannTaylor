### 2017-09-18: Distant reading
 "What is Distant Reading"
  
    "To understand literature, Moretti argues, we must stop reading books."
          - This article was very interesting because of the idea. Moretti claims that no matter how many books someone reads, there is no way they would read every book about an area. There are thousands of books about the same thing, and perhaps a digital program would make it easier for someone to compare everything. 
     "I admire Moretti’s honesty in saying this: most scholars, whatever their disciplinary background, do not publish negative results.But I would admire it more if he didn’t elsewhere dismiss qualitative literary analysis as “a theological exercise.”"
          _ I am still a little bit confused what is meant by this. I understand what is meant that someone would not publish negative results for their own agenda. But I am lost what is meant by a "theological excercise". 
 
"Jocker's"

   "We understand that the conclusions drawn are only as good as the evidence gathered, and we hope that the gathering of evidence is done both ethically and completely."
          - This goes back to what we talked about in class. That we can "hope" that evidence is gathered ethically and in a truthful manner, but there is always a chance that the data can be scewed. 
   "The approach to the study of literature that I am calling “macroanalysis” is in some general ways akin to economics or, more specifically, to macroeconomics."
          - I am still unsure how they are connecting this approach is considred similar to economics. I understand the information about data and collecting/arranging information gathered. 
 
"Graphs, Maps, and Trees" Franco Moretti

   "Because if the downturns are individual events, then looking for individual causes (Napoleon, reprints, the cost of paper, whatever) makes perfect sense; but if they are parts of a pattern, then what we must explain is the pattern as a whole, not just one of its phases." (pg. 13)
         - This is very interesting because it reminds someone to look at what is happening overall with a graph versus just looking at one part. I think a lot of the time when we are looking at a graph, we notice the high/mins/ the outliers, but looking at the trend is just as important. 
   "Here, the methodology of the book reveals its pragmatic ambition: for me, abstraction is not an end in itself, but a way to widen the domain of the literary historian, and enrich its internal problematic."
         - After reading the first chapter, I am still confused what is being referred to as an abstraction. If we are talking about how to find data on literary books by sorting and organizing data we gather from the books, I am unsure what the abstraction is. Why would it be an end?
