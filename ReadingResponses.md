### 2017-09-18: Distant reading
 "What is Distant Reading"
  
    "To understand literature, Moretti argues, we must stop reading books."
          - This article was very interesting because of the idea. Moretti claims that no matter how many books someone reads, there is no way they would read every book about an area. There are thousands of books about the same thing, and perhaps a digital program would make it easier for someone to compare everything. 
     "I admire Moretti’s honesty in saying this: most scholars, whatever their disciplinary background, do not publish negative results.But I would admire it more if he didn’t elsewhere dismiss qualitative literary analysis as “a theological exercise.”"
           -I am still a little bit confused what is meant by this. I understand what is meant that someone would not publish negative results for their own agenda. But I am lost what is meant by a "theological excercise". 
 
"Jocker's"

   "We understand that the conclusions drawn are only as good as the evidence gathered, and we hope that the gathering of evidence is done both ethically and completely."
          - This goes back to what we talked about in class. That we can "hope" that evidence is gathered ethically and in a truthful manner, but there is always a chance that the data can be scewed. 
   "The approach to the study of literature that I am calling “macroanalysis” is in some general ways akin to economics or, more specifically, to macroeconomics."
          - I am still unsure how they are connecting this approach is considred similar to economics. I understand the information about data and collecting/arranging information gathered. 
 
"Graphs, Maps, and Trees" Franco Moretti

   "Because if the downturns are individual events, then looking for individual causes (Napoleon, reprints, the cost of paper, whatever) makes perfect sense; but if they are parts of a pattern, then what we must explain is the pattern as a whole, not just one of its phases." (pg. 13)
         - This is very interesting because it reminds someone to look at what is happening overall with a graph versus just looking at one part. I think a lot of the time when we are looking at a graph, we notice the high/mins/ the outliers, but looking at the trend is just as important. 
   "Here, the methodology of the book reveals its pragmatic ambition: for me, abstraction is not an end in itself, but a way to widen the domain of the literary historian, and enrich its internal problematic."
         - After reading the first chapter, I am still confused what is being referred to as an abstraction. If we are talking about how to find data on literary books by sorting and organizing data we gather from the books, I am unsure what the abstraction is. Why would it be an end? 
          

### 2017-09-25: Topic modeling I

### 2017-10-02: Topic Modeling II

##### Signs art 40
"Using Topic Modeling, a computer-assisted means of dividing a large corpus of texts into topics, this browser explores the Signs archive by dividing it into several topics and tracing how those topics change over time." 
      - I find this description of topic modeling easier to understand than previously in class. Topic modeling is using the computer to divde a corpus into topics. 
"Feminist scholars, purse lines of inquiry and analysis prompted by this anniversary project, particularly the topic modeling." 
      - I am a bit confused what it means that scholars take topic modeling and create projects. I understand that using topic modeling, you get a list of relevant topics for a select number of journals. But I do not understand where you go from there. 
##### Mining the Dispatch
"The former was produced by scholars, librarians and technologists at the University of Richmond and Tufts University's Perseus Project."
      - I had no idea that this was produced by people at the University of Richmond. It is really interesting to see things that people on campus are doing or have helped to create. 
      
"It uses as its evidence nearly the full run of the Richmond Daily Dispatch from the eve of Lincoln's election in November 1860 through the evacuation of the city in April 1865 (at which point publication of the Dispatch ceased) to December 1865 (when publication of the Dispatch resumed), an archive of over 112,000 pieces consisting of nearly 24 million words."
      - This is interesting, as I did not think that there would be so many pieces during that time. I understand that it was historically Richmond based, but I wonder if including more from other large cities at the time, would have helped understand what was going on. Isn't it better to look macro versus micro?

##### Text Analysis of Trump's Tweets
  
"When Trump wishes the Olympic team good luck, he’s tweeting from his iPhone. When he’s insulting a rival, he’s usually tweeting from an Android. "
      - I find this very interesting that we can apply topic modeling to more things that just literary journals. I think this helps me connect topic modeling into something I could use. 

"Overall, this includes 628 tweets from iPhone, and 762 tweets from Android."
      - I do wonder if this is enough of a database. Could they have gone further back to include texts previously to running to office? How large does the corpus need to be? 
      
##### Data Miners Dig for Answers About Harper Lee, Truman Capote and ‘Go Set a Watchman’
"Hours after “Go Set a Watchman”went on sale Tuesday, the developers of a
computerized text­analysis tool ran the long­awaited novel and Ms. Lee’s Pulitzer­Prize
winning “To Kill a Mockingbird” through an algorithm that searched for signs of heavy
editing, frequent rewriting and other influences."

     -I found this amazing that someone/ a program can help determine if it took alot of rewriting while creating a book. I have read "Go set a Watchman" after reading "To Kill a Mockingbird" and there was definitely a different voice throughout the book. I find it really cool that we can use a computer program to discover that too. 
"The researchers used a computer program to tally the frequency of common words —“the,” “a,” “he,” “she”—and other “function” words that they said typically make up 50%
of a novel."
       - I thought we did not use connecting words with software that we use? Or is it something that is based on each project and what that person is looking for?
