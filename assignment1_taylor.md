## Data Documentation

  I picked a humanities topic relating to nutrition and how healthy a morning pick-me-up is. In today’s society, people are constantly on the go. This has led to a surge of fast food companies throughout the world today. In America alone, we have thousands of fast food companies, all thriving on the fact that Americans have a limited amount of time between working and the hundreds of daily tasks we are to perform. In order to get my data set, I looked at the largest morning fast food companies in America. I wanted to answer just how healthy people’s morning beverage choices are which can affect their nutrition. 
	Nutrition plays a role in every single living species on Earth. If a plant does not receive the adequate amount of vitamin D or water, it will shrivel up and die. Many nutritionists claim that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, fueling our days to perform the hundreds of tasks humans are meant to perform throughout a day. Using the data, I collected, someone is able to analyze the grams of sugar in a 16oz drink from some of the most popular fast food restaurants in America. I used the same 16 oz size for each drink in order to give a better analysis for each drink. If I had compared a 12 oz drink versus a 20oz drink, the 20z of course would have more sugar, but it would not be translated to the reader as easily. Also, one can also notice what they are getting for the price in comparison to what they are getting. Are they getting syrup and cream, or actual milk? 
	Another major issue as of lately are food allergies. Certain foods contain allergens that can cause people to have a reaction. Looking at the data I collected, a person can understand of the drinks I gathered data on, what allergen is in the type of drink. Nutrition is something that contains a bunch of different parts. This can mean that some people are looking at how many carbohydrates, how many grams of sugar, or what kind of fat is in certain foods. I broke my data into a subset of fats, that way it could be easily identified for which kind of fat is in the drink. Total fat is the sum of the saturated fats, trans fats, and other fats. Most of the time, trans fat is seen as the bad kind of fat, the type that is very hard to get rid of and tends to collect on people’s hearts. Then there is saturated fat, which in moderation is good for the body. Gathering data on these particular fields, help understand what is being put in our bodies first thing in the morning. 
	My sources for data included the sites of each fast food company: McDonalds.com, BurgerKing.com, Panerabread.com, Sonicdrivein.com, DunkinDonuts.com, Peets.com, Cinnabon.com, Starbucks.com. Each website has the nutritional information given including the allergy information.
