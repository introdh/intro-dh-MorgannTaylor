Data Source : https://fastfood.theringer.com/

I chose to use data from Fastfood.com.theringer.com. The Ringer, a news source, asked its staff to nominate their 100 top fast food favorites. Once there were 100 nominations, they elected on the top 50. I then took their data and organized it into a Google Doc in order to arrange my nodes and edges. My edges were which restaurant has what food item. The nodes were the name and the type. I wanted to connect which restaurants were voted for what favorite item. I took the data and arranged it by a general name. In the rankings, some of the food items were specific, but i generalized them to understand the connections a bit more. If it said cheeseburger, for example, I would put burger. This helps to see the connections between the items without it seperating different chains just based on the specific name. A McDonalds Big Mac and a Burger King Whopper are both burgers. I was able to do this without altering the meaning of the data. Once I put it into the software, R, I was able to see how the restaurants connected, selling similar items as others. 

I chose this data to answer a few humanities questions. One could use this data to figure out which restaurants in a certain area are selling which items. For example, a new taco fast food place, may see that there are four other fast food restaurants within a certain area. According to the data from The Ringer, there are three places that sell tacos. So looking at the area for a potential new restaurant, the new place may not want to build in such heavy competition. My network can also help decide competition. According to The Ringer, there is only one place that rates high for Cheese Curds. Therefore, a new restaurant may decide that they could compete with better cheese curds and find themselves a niche. More questions with the network I made could be about what people are eating when they choose fast food, where they are going, or the most common items. 

According to Moretti, even after a network has been made, we still need to bring questions and meaning to the graph. (Moretti, Pamphlet, 2011). Moretti created a graph of the conversations between characters within Hamlet. If someone were to look at that graph, they would not see that there is any meaning. Perhaps that one person is connected to another, but nothing more. Each graph needs context. Just like my network that I created, there needs to be more to it. Just looking at my nodes and edges, we gather the name of a restaurant, and the name of food items. But the meaning needs to be understood. Also, we need to take the information as not 100% true or unbiased. My network was based off of personal opinions from the staff of The Ringer. This does not mean they are reportedly the best selling, or the best tasting. It is a favorite of a group of people. Over and over again, we are seeing that data is a group of numbers, until they are given meanings.
