Questions and Tasks
Initial Impressions
Look at the two intro pages and center the map but hold off on clicking anything. We’d like to get your initial impressions before you start exploring.

•	It seems very straight forward. The wording in the first intro page seems a bit confusing, not so straight forward as it should be. 

From what time period does this site present information?
•	1955-1966

How would you summarize the type of information this site presents?
•	The site is presenting information about where people in the U.S. during this time were displaced from their families. This includes smaller cities as well as larger cities. 

What do you think the different sized circles that appear across the map represent?
•	The larger cirlces represent areas that had the larger population of people who were displaced. Thus, smaller circles show areas of smaller populations of families that were displaced. 

What do you think the different colors of the circles are meant to convey?
•	The colors represent the race. The more purple the more African Americans and the more green the more white people. Blue shows that there are is no data present. 
Exploration
Spend five minutes exploring the site by clicking on different sections. 

Let us know if anything is  surprising or confusing.

•	I dislike that if you go back, then you are now existed out of the page. It is a little confusing how to close the box or city that we are in. 
•	Also, when I place my mouse over an area, you the information on the side goes away when you try to scroll it. 
•	It is hard when there are two cities within one area

Specific Tasks
Now that you’ve had some time to explore, we’re going to ask you to perform a few specific tasks:

Task One
- In 1966, which city’s projects displaced the most families?
•	Chicago
- How many from Nashville, TN that year?
•	2.3k

Was anything difficult or frustrating about accomplishing this task? 
•	The larger cities are not labeled. I had to hover over all of them to find Nashville after selecting the year at the bottom. I noticed that other people’s screens showed the cities were labeled. 

Task Two
How would you go about finding the number of displacements Minneapolis for all years? Go ahead and access that information. 

Was anything difficult or frustrating about accomplishing this task?
•	No. Was fairly easy to type in Minneapolis into the search bar. 
Task Three
- How many urban renewal projects were there in Richmond, VA, that displaced people?
•	2
- How much funding did the Carver project in Richmond receive?
•	1,102,352
- How does that funding compare to the average of other projects in cities roughly Richmond’s size?
•	Majority have the same amount, but there are others that have a lot more. 
- Among comparably sized cities (100-250K), which single project displaced the most people? 
•	Edgehill, Nashville Tennessee. 

Was anything difficult or frustrating about accomplishing this task?
•	It was fairly easy to find these answers. 

Task Four
Can you determine one or two cities or towns that had large white populations (90% or more) but overwhelmingly displaced families of color (90% or more of displacements)?


Was anything difficult or frustrating about accomplishing this task?

Task Five
- Which project displaced the most white families in Dayton, OH?
•	Eastside
- Which the most families of color?
•	Perry-Mead
- With the most total families?
•	Perry-Mead

Was anything difficult or frustrating about accomplishing this task?
•	It was fairly easy to understand and gage from the map. 

Overall Impressions
Are there improvements we could make to this site that you haven’t mentioned yet? We’d appreciate your suggestions.
•	I wish projects were defined a bit more. Projects as in areas, not other projects going on about the information. That could be my own difficulty, but after looking at other sites in class, but I would think project as a bit different. 

Post-Test Questionnaire
What frustrated you most about this site?

•	I really dislike how you can hover over a city, and on the right side information is given about the city. I want to be able to scroll more about it without having to click the location. I wonder if you could double click to get to the city and then one click to select it but not to zoom in. 

If you had a magic wand, how would you improve this site?
•	I would be able to click on a location without it going into the map deeper. One click to lock in the information on the side table/chart. And then two clicks to get deeper into the map. 

What do you like about the site?
•	It is fairly easy to read and understand. I enjoy all of the visual aids. Also the site looks extremely modern and interesting. I enjoy that the states are not shown and there is more of a focus on the areas. Also, I enjoy the rivers and how they stand out. I think it helps understand why cities were started in the first place.
•	I enjoy the labels given and the bold. 

How likely are you to recommend this site to a friend or colleague interested in U.S. History (0=Not at all likely, and 10=Very Likely)?

I think it would be great as an easy tool to view racism and displa
